If I remember correctly the queen died that night happily listening to the babies in the nursey and loving all of them as they were now her daughters.

I think there were nine marbles in the bag: eight of one color, and one of another (maybe black and white, maybe a different number of marbles). If he drew the odd marble, the gang performed the violent act he had devised on him instead. In the end, the gang leader turned on the smart boy and stacked the bag with all marbles of the same color to ensure that he would have to suffer the violent attack. I read this in the mid- to late-1970s, so I'm guessing it was written in the late 1960s or early 1970s."}
{"book_id":24885730,"query":"HelloI'm looking for a book that I read quite long ago when I was in elementary school- around 2011.What I remember about the plot is that it was about the pied piper of Hamelin. He lures a group of children from their homes and leads them into a cave which opens up to a forest on the other side, I think. One of the children is a boy who is lame or broke his leg. Not sure which but he was slower than the rest and eventually got left behind near the cave. The main character is his sister (or friends... Not sure) and she follows the piper to the other side. I can't remember what happens after that but I think the children become cursed and turn into animals at night or something. Only the main character does not turn.

I don't remember the reason, but I do remember that throughout the book she experience strange occurrences like visions and dreams. She meets a boy at the school who becomes a focal point to the story and to her strange experiences. 2. The atmosphere of the location and the book is dark and dreary most of the time. It was almost always dark or raining (at least the parts I remember at least). There was also a lot of mention and description of the \"moors\" by the school. (Definition of moors: open uncultivated land; a heath). This imagery makes me think it was based in the UK but I'm not sure. 3. There was a moment in the book, late at night, where she is either sleepwalking or purposefully exiting the school and goes swimming in a pond nearby. One moment she is alone and I think the next moment, the boy is swimming\/floating next to her. I can't remember if this is a vision or not. He may have even influenced her to go out to that location to meet him as I feel like no one was allowed to know that they were meeting\/knew each other. 4. At the end of the book, the boy interrupts a meeting or ritual being completed by school officials (who I believe were portrayed to be nuns). The school officials were scared of this boy for some reason. I feel like the story had to do with an immortal lover (the boy) and his reincarnated soul mate (the female), but that is just speculation. I believe this book was the first one of a series, but I never read further than this book so I don't know how the story developed."}

The zebras sewed the scraps of black fabric together to make handsome coats for themselves.

I think the MC was a singer\/guitarist who was inspired by a woman rock legend in the making (named something like Ruby X or something).I'm not sure what their big break was, but it seems that overnight they're signed by a huge record label, playing on the radio, and getting TV interviews. I think this book takes place in the UK because during the interviews, they reference real-life girl group Atomic Kitten, saying things like, \"Well if they can get number ones by releasing garbage, why can't we?\" The MC's age gets brought up a lot too, as she's still only 17, while the other band members are already legal, so she makes plans to become a party girl as soon as she's allowed to. I think this may have been a point of contention to her parents, who were still trying to protect her from that lifestyle, while she was just looking forward to the day where they could no longer control her life.Once she turns 18, she follows through on that promise and has no problem drinking and partying way too much, and I think ends up on a tabloid or two because of it. After one party, as she's stumbling back to her hotel room, another woman from that same party stumbles past her, clearly drunk and strung out, probably hanging off of some guy's arm. It isn't until after that woman is on a separate elevator that the MC realizes that she was Ruby-X-or-something, the very person that she used to idolize, and who inspired her to pursue rock stardom in the first place. And she looked so terrible the the MC didn't even recognize her.The rest of the book, I think, was about the gradual break up of the band. The MC and her best friend (who was on her way to following Ruby-X-or-something's lead onto a path of drinking and partying and drugs herself) try to reason with the other members, wanting to get back to a point where they were doing this for the love of music, not to just be famous. They refuse, and the MC and best friend leave the band, and are replaced by the record label.The book ends sometime later, recounting that their old band was not churning out the same quality that they used to (I think the MC wrote the best songs), but were still headlining tabloids. The MC feels a pang of sadness at seeing the state of her old friends, especially since Ruby-X-or-something has since passed away due to an overdose. She was really young. MC and her now sober best friend have since started a new band, and got signed by a record label \"too small to afford to buy us lunch,\" but on purpose as they're still wary from their previous encounter with a huge label. They're moderately successful, with is just fine with the MC, as she's now free to focus on her music."}

He is very handsome though, and would sing, \"Do you lo-o-o-ove me?\" to someone before killing them.Later on in the series, the girl falls in love with the Wild Man, but never acts on those feelings because she's not confident in her appearance compared to how handsome he is (she might admit to her feelings at some point in the series after I lost track of the series).The MC meanwhile, somehow becomes the host to a god, and slowly starts losing his humanity over time. He doesn't become cruel or a tyrant as far as I remember, but he starts to see himself as separate from humanity and worldliness.A plotline to one of the books is that the girl gets captured by a kingdom that intends to use her for some sort of religious sacrifice.

She has this best friend who's lesbian- her girlfriend's name was Nadine I think or maybe Natalie- and an ex boyfriend named Simon who is a garbage human being. He forces himself on her and kisses her, and it activates her power. Basically what it does, is her kiss turns dead things into what is basically a guardian ghost and it makes living people obsessed with her. She finds this out after Simon brings her a dead kitten that she kisses on top of the head while her best friend chases him off. *She* sees it come back to life, but her sanity is *dwindling* and she's getting really sick. The kitten actually becomes a ghost thing that follows her around instead. The book ends with Simon getting her and her best friend in a violent car crash where both Simon and her best friend dies. She kisses her best friend, turning her into one of those ghost things, and doesn't do the same for Simon 'cause that's what he wanted.

I think she then speaks to the older boy's mom...who is maybe a social worker....she is babysitting one day and she sees that the wife is trying to feed the baby, but he doesn't want to eat, so she stabs the metal spoon into his mouth and yells at him. The girl realizes that the wife is the one beating up the child. I think the book implies that the wife was abusing because of ignorance and not malice. I do not remember the resolution. Maybe she tells the father because I remember a scene where he is near tears about it."}

The main character is a young girl who has an older sister, and their relationship is a major point in the book. The MC has a friend named Blue, I think. There is a scene in the book where the MC and her sister go to a party and the MC forgets to bring her shoes so she shows up wearing a pair of socks. At the party there's a boy that the older sister has a crush on\/is in a relationship with and he's going around trying to kiss as many girls as he can, and the MC was going to be \"lucky number seven\". The older sister is very upset about this and cries but the MC comforts her and gives her her socks to wipe her eyes and nose.

{"book_id":6061941,"query":"Since this group helped me find another book I was searching for so easily last time, I want to see if I can get help for another book.I read this book somewhere between 2008-2013 (probably leaning toward the latter half of that range, but I want to cast a wide enough net just in case). Most likely the book was new at the time I read it, and it was  not published later than October of 2013, because I moved away from my library then.The setting in the book seemed to be a U.S. school system, so I'd wager the book was U.S. published. It was Young Adult Contemporary (modern setting), and I'm fairly sure it was a stand-alone (not a series or anything).It was about a student named Micheal, and I believe he was just entering his first day of high school (so 14 years old or so). The book was entirely from his perspective (either first person POV or third, but limited to him). Near the beginning of the book, when it was introducing the character, there was a whole description of how his name was spelled with an \"ea\" instead of an \"ae\" like the name is more commonly spelled. I believe one of his parents was careless or drunk when signing his birth certificate and accidentally spelled the name wrong? Anyway, he has a best friend (a guy) the same age that he went to middle school with and they were both anxious\/excited about starting a new year of school in a new building (the high school and middle school were separate). Micheal ends up seeing a girl he doesn't know (same age), and he realizes she must have gone to a different middle school than him (either she was new to town or the high school had students coming from multiple middle schools). He instantly likes her and introduces himself to her. I think she had long brown hair (I'm not positive), and I remember it mentioning that she was wearing lip gloss or something because he kept noticing her lips, and she also frequently played with her hair throughout the book. I don't remember much else, except that I think when he met her he lied to her about himself in some way to impress her. That, or he planned to lie, then didn't end up going through with it. That's basically all I remember about the story - I can't remember any details about the main plot or where the story went from there (it makes me question if I ever got to actually finish the book). My sister remembers me telling her about it back when I read it at the time, and she recalls a part where Micheal and the girl he liked were sneaking around the school for some reason and ended up hiding in a bush. I do vaguely remember that, so I believe that's an accurate scene. Also, by the way, I'm 100% positive that the author was male.Any help would be appreciated. I hope someone out there remembers the \"Micheal\" vs, \"Michael\" spelling section in the book, because I feel like that could be a giveaway if someone knows the book well. Thanks again in advanance."}

The girl may have had a younger sister or friend. This book was definitely set around Christmas time, i think it was snowing and night time when she saw the doll. Possibly Victorian period but maybe a little later. I recall a dark book cover with a doll behind a latticed window. I can't recall exactly how the story rounds up but I know there was a kindly shopkeeper that put you in mind of st Nicholas. The story starts sad but I'm pretty sure it had a happy heartwarming ending. This book is definitely not A Little Princess or The Christmas Doll by Elvira Woodruff or Jason Wright or Carol Beach York or Amy Sparks."}

Eventually it is revealed that this friend's brother had been sexually abusing his sister for years. She kills herself, if I remember correctly she hung herself in the shower of her home.I remember a scene where the main character first learns about pregnancy and is scared of it.

I new girl moves to town and they hit it off. They spend time together, probably at the mall. The girl gets a new outfit then does some cutting and refashioning to it to make it unique. Their hormones quickly lead to them getting carried away in a car. I remember a comedic moment where the boy is like \"semen, is tricky, but I don't think it can walk across the carpet. Then there was a whole segment of shopping for safe sex paraphernalia. They meet up at his house to \"study\". He thinks it would be sexy to wear a robe, but when he puts it on it just looks silly. He winds up blurting out \"I don't want to study!\", and they have sex instead. He bought condoms and she bought spermicidal foam. There's another humorous bit where he's like, \"my stomach is smaller when I lay down. I wish we could go through life laying down\" and she's like \"I don't, my breasts are smaller when I lay down\".There are also two other side characters. The main male characters best friend and their female alternative type friend. Those two wind up hooking up as well off screen. There was the conversation between the MC and the best friend about what they used for protection and the best friend was like, \"I just assumed she had taken care of it\" (I eyerolled even back then when I read this). That's all I can remember. I can't say it was an excellent book, but it was sex positive YA with plenty of information about safe sex."}
{"book_id":9200779,"query":"I believe I read this book in the first half of the 2010s it didn't appear brand new at the time and I think it may have had some miles on it. The book is a mystery that follows a group of kids who discover that the criminals of the story had stolen silver plates and other dining utensils from a local lodge\/ community area. I am lead to believe lodge because the book takes place in a more wilderness area and this lodge is positioned on a lake, this lake had an island which is where the main characters had a fort. The criminals I remember had loaded up this silver dinnerware into a duffel bag and tossed it into the lake to keep it hidden until they could get it. I think the kids fort was made out of logs. I remeber the scence when they discover the crime scence and the whole area is taped off with police tape. I read a paperback version of the book and the cover art featured the lake with the island and a full moon. I think the main character was male. I read it in the states. I'm going to separate this information because I'm not positive its related or if I'm imagining it... I think the silver dinnerware may have owned by Teddy Roosevelt or was a gift from him to the lodge, I remember thinking that a person was in the duffel bag because there may have been someone who went missing, I think one of the characters saw the people throw the duffel bag over board, I think the title included something about silver or moon, I'm also pretty sure the kids got around using canoes, they may have also lived on the lake.

It's about a girl (MC) whose *SPOILER* sister has died, but the girl thinks she's still alive and hallucinates her or shapes her reality to fit her sister being alive. You don't know throughout the whole book until they reveal that her sister has actually passed away. I think a lighthouse is involved. Her sister may have died around the lighthouse. There's a boy in this story who the main character falls in love with. Edit: I just remembered but I think the chapters switch between the two sisters, which is actually just the MC going between her own mind and her sister's mind which you don't figure out till the very end. There's a scene in a car where the boy and the MC are talking and she says, \"You said her name\" because the MC is now in her sister's mind. You think you're reading the sister's perspective and think that the boy said the MC's name, but it's really the MC in her own mind.

In the beginning of the book she was living in a village completely guarded by a large and tall wire fence. Behind the fence was a dark forest where the undead roamed. Criminals and infected people where banished from the village into the forest. The protagonist was kicked out of the village for what I think was due to a crime she committed or due to an infection that however didn't make her into a zombie actually because she was immune (I'm not sure of this part). I remember her talking to her mother shortly before she was banished from the village and also that her father was only mentioned briefly in the book because he was dead.

The two kids generally fight the robots, but end up befriending one somehow and he helps them find this big group of people who are living in a large cave on the island and have built a ship that they are going to try and sail to get off the island.

If it helps, the narrator on the audiobook was female.The story was about a girl (can't remember her name) who lived in a town with a wall around it. She was in high school and the things that they would learn were very strictly factual. No fiction or imaginary stories were ever taught to them. The girl's family was relatively poor. She was coming of age where she was supposed graduate and get matched up to be in an arranged marriage. If I remember correctly, she was being paired up with the mayor's son, and she wasn't very interested in him, but his family had money. To graduate, she had to give some sort of private presentation. While she was on stage, a mischievous boy let some cows or pigs into the auditorium. She heard him laughing up on the rafters and followed him to confront him. She ended up being very intrigued by him and they started meeting in private. In the meantime, she's also getting paired up with this other boy that she's not really interested in, but they are somewhat friends. His dad has a secured office that he was never supposed to go into and I remember a dialogue between him and the girl where he tells her there is this story about a girl whose house was swept away by a tornado and it landed in a different place where little people called munchkins and a good witch send her on a quest down a yellow brick road to find her way home. After hearing this short snip of what was clearly the Wizard of Oz, the girl replied, \"Then what happened?\" and the boy said, \"I don't know. That's as far as I got.\" Back to the boy that she really liked.... They make a plan to escape into the wild so they can be together and they end up living with this group of people; one of their name's was Raven. The boy had to go back into town for supplies and ended up being captured. Can't remember a lot of detail here....but somehow the mayor's son ends up with her in the wild so she has this love-triangle situation when her captive lover escapes and finds her again. Still burry on the details.... but I believe there was a war in the end between the people in the wild and the walled town.

{"book_id":11104052,"query":"Hello! I am looking for a YA fantasy book that I used to love when I was in middle school\/high school from around 2007-2013. The book was in the third person (I think) and followed two young royals, a boy and girl, who had been betrothed to ease tensions between their countries and broker an alliance. However, the two teens were not especially fond of the idea and were in fact rather insolent and troublesome about it. Their parents (a king for one and a queen for the other maybe?) had sent them off together on an excursion when their carriage was set up on by bandits who captured them both and moved them across the boarder into a third country run by a notorious war lord (???). SPOILERS...So I'm gonna tag for spoilers here because I believe all of that was pretty much in the plot description for the book. Anyway, once in the other country I believe they sold as slaves and in end up in the household of the warlord where he recognizes at least one of the two of them and welcomes them as a guest in his household. However, I believe the other is left as a slave either intentionally or not and has a fairly bad time of it. I remember there being some sort of courtyard staged scene maybe that one has to watch the other do. Obviously my memory gets foggy around here. What I believe happens next is the two teens get word of a war brewing in their two countries over their disappearance and either warlord plans to take advantage of this dissent to press his own agenda or has actually aided in the plot. They decide they need to escape and get back to their own land and I believe they stage a slave rebellion and burn his home to the ground. I also think he may have had several wives? From here the two make their way towards boarder and maybe join some kind of resistance and slowly morph into the leaders they were not at the beginning of the book. There is eventually a little romance between the two of them and seem to recall it being the sort of thing where the boy releases her from their obligation and there is some tension of does he\/does she like me though and eventually they figure it out. As far as other details go, I think there was a name of a bird in the tile something like \"The sparrow and the lark\". It feels like it was Lark or Nightingale maybe. I read it in the late 2000s and at the time it felt a little bit old. Like maybe it was written in the 90s. I read it as a hardback from my local library and it was not especially long, maybe 250 pages. It definitely felt more on the middle grade reader side of YA but I believe both of the lead characters were in the 15-18 range. That's all I remember and I hope you can help. Thank you!"}

SPOILERSShe first learns that the family's circumstances have changed from her older brother, who is driving a car while she rides in the passenger seat. She gets so angry at him, she throws his hat out of the car. He doesn't notice until later and carefully controls his anger, just saying, \"Okay.\" Around the same time, her father, who has lost his job (?), goes out one morning to join the snow shoveling crews to earn some money. The mom faints at seeing him heading out. The main character moves in with a female relative, I believe an aunt, in a more Southern state. She attends a new school, which is a big adjustment. She used to attend a small private school, so things like how to work a locker are new to her . She drops her pencil the first time she hears the school bell. At school she befriends a male character who is described as \"homely.\" She also notices a female classmate whose family seems to be in dire straits. They might live in the woods. The classmate has a younger sibling who is blind. I think the classmate is initially defensive and secretive, but eventually comes to trust the main character. The plot ultimately revolves around the MC and homely boy helping the poorer classmate's family. They may fix up a car that the classmate uses somehow to better their circumstances. The book concludes on the Fourth of July with the main character sitting outside after the fireworks and reflecting on how her life has changed."}
{"book_id":137974,"query":"I read this book in the late 90s but it could be from as early as the 70s. It was one of my fathers books but he sold them all and doesn't remember this one.I'm going to tell the plot in chronological order but it isn't written that way.The main character (I think her name is Sarah) is witnessing an uprising of mechanical people. I will call them cyborgs but the book might have used a different term like androids, or robots. Her grandfather invented them and they are the only ones capable of time travel. So she attempts suicide (I think. I also think it was very bloody and in a bathroom) so her grandfather will be forced to turn her into a cyborg so she can travel back in time to convince him not to invent them. (this is all revealed at the end, I think the book starts in the middle of her having a weird dream). Traveling back in time erases her memory and she is found wandering the streets. She goes to live with a family and she calls them Mom and Dad even though she knows they aren't really. She goes to highschool and does highschool stuff. She starts to get really close to a boy. We get snippets of things as the story progresses but aren't sure of the larger plot. She sees people who talk about her but not TO her (\"Why is she wasting her time on this?\" kind of stuff) and sees a doctor for this (a neurologist or a therapist maybe?) The bulk of the book is really weird and confusing but that made me just want to keep reading so I could figure out what was going on. Everything gets revealed at the end of the book. She remembers who she is and why she's there. The boy she had been getting close to is her grandfather. She downloads a message for him from her head to a VCR tape maybe? He watches it and realizes that if he doesn't invent the cyborgs then he'll never see her again. So he resolves to invent them. I think the people she was seeing were other cyborgs who are invisible? or memory fragments maybe? The end of the book insinuates that her grandfather makes the cyborgs and then convinces his eventual daughter to name her daughter (Sarah?) so that he can see her again. It was such a good ending, very sad but also satisfying and I loved the way most of the book was confusing but it all clicked together at the end of it."}

Spoiler alert for plot:Main characters are older Teen\/ 18+ Male and Female. They live in a society which has a border wall (to keep people in and unfriendlies out) its a Utopian society, but only because 10+ years ago the government decided to round up all the disabled and disfigured people and cast them out of the city forcing them into the sewers. Government believe there's no contact with these unwanted people, but they sometimes sneak into the city through sewer systems.Male protagonist fancies Female protagonist and so, to impress her, tells her his secret. The secret being he knows about the sewer people because one of them is his brother (who was born without an arm). He takes her down into the sewers to meet his brother, and she ends up falling in love with the one armed brother.The male protagonist is royally miffed by this turn of events and exposes the sewer people to the government.The Paper flower on the front cover is relevant because I believe one of the sewer children (it may be the one armed brother) makes the flowers from old books and sends them out of the sewers to the 'surface world' as to show people they're down there.If anyone remembers this book, or is able to tell me the title, I'd really appreciate it!"}

The boy is a self-taught musician and artist and made a heart wreath out of sticks for the girl.

And later the asthmatic brother has a horrible asthma attack and the boy takes him to the girls house and the mom immediately takes care of him and even gets an inhaler for him. I don't remember if the boys ran away from home, or if they were already homeless with their abusive father and just left to an abandoned house, but I do remember that the dad is always gone and he finds them and is mad that his son is falling in love with the girl and says that the son doesn't care about his family if he's just going to leave them for the girl. The dad is also mad about his younger son having an inhaler and doesn't want him to have it.

I remember very little of it except that it was about a young girl whose first love (i think a shy young man with glasses) goes off to war.

She has basically given up hope of his return, when one day he is standimg under that tree or near that tree and asks her ti marry him.

It follows a highschool boy, who is super smart and also a star runningback, who discovers he is destined to save the Earth. He's actually from the dystopian future and the son of some king or similarly important figure. That's why he's so much more athletic and smarter than everyone else. He goes on missions to stop the trajectory the earth is headed towards... I remember it being somewhat ecologically focused in a sense. He has a girlfriend from the present (our time) who he isn't supposed to end up with, but I think he does anyways. Any guidance much appreciated. Thanks!"}

She tried to defend him and knew the lifetime of the sun and suggested that landing on the sun would technically not be impossible if you went after then.I also seem to remember the school librarian in the story printed out her browsing history to discuss it with her, as the sites she was going to were apparently too advanced for her grade level. I feel like I remember some kind of figurative imagery about the librarian was shining a light around and since the girl could no longer hide, she would bring the librarian into her corner with her.I don't remember why she had to hide how smart she was, but I feel like there was mention that she purposefully got average scores, and hid it from all of the teachers. I don't recall if she hid it from her parents, though.I think it was set in elementary school, but it is possible that it was middle school."}

The man died from bullet wounds and his weapon was a rifle or a bow.The 2 main characters fall in love and kiss at least once.At some point in the book it is discovered that every person has a reaper following them until it is their time to die and then he helps them cross the river to the afterlife. The reaper might be shackled to each person's foot (?). The reaper is invisible to most humans but for some reason either the girl or the boy could see them after some point in the book.The reapers are depicted as kinda understanding beings.The main character's one was pretty empathetic at times.One of the main characters is able to talk to his\/her reaper after some point in the book.One of the main characters stays at the house of his\/her reaper for some time and other reapers are there. (?)One of the main characters is accompanied by their reaper into a river. I believe that crossing the river is supposed to kill the person. One of the main characters either goes in or completely crosses the river to save the other one (?) but doesn't die.I believe that the boy was the son of an important being (?)The boy had a dagger in his possesion which seemed pretty important during the whole story (?)I believe that in the book there was an inner conflict between angels or angels and devils (?) God was basically too old and weak to rule anymore and he was being basically safekept by some angels who slowly assumed power and ruled in his stead using his name. I believe that was one of the reasons that caused the conflict I mentioned. If I recall correctly God during the years of the main characters was incompetent perhaps even cruel and that caused chaos to the worlds\/dimensions.God's main protector was a male angel (?) A world\/dimension war broke out at some point because people wanted to kill the God (?)the God eventually died when he left Heaven, if I recall correctly there was a fight between those accompanying him and the rebels (?)I think that he was in some sort of protective sphere and he kinda melted to the air when that dissapeared (?)I think that he was happy when he died cos he had lived past his time and just wanted to rest.the girl and the boy were kinda close to the place where he died (?)I think that the boy had something to do with his death but I'm not sure.The girl had some sort of animal\/pet that was extremely intelligent and protective of her (?)The cover of the book was all blue (?)The book was translated in Greek.If you have bothered reading till this point I thank you from the bottom of my heart, I've been trying to find this book for ages."}

She goes to school that day as if nothing happened, but when she sees her classmates who were in her dream, she suddenly feels an urge to speak with them.

I think she might have had an older sister that she felt like she had to live up to, and that or just regular pressure from her parents was keeping her from following her real dreams\/she was very good at ballet and was weighing where her talent lay vs her passion. The only scene I recall clearly is that she's sitting at the piano and watching her profile in the mirror and considering her appearance, how it wasn't \"strictly necessary for a dancer to be beautiful, but it was good to have a symmetrical face\" and so on, basically the author sneaking in the MC's description in as natural a way as possible when the book was from first person or third person limited. I believe the cover was a closeup of the main character's face in profile or angled slightly toward the reader but with eyes downcast, and that she was blond.There is a possibility that I am misremembering the premise and that it's the other way around - MC is on track to get into Julliard or expy school for piano but she really wants to be a ballerina but I think it's more likely the other way around."}

{"book_id":8697869,"query":"I've had a really hard time finding this series. I read it as a kid in the early 2000s, and loved it. It's a series that's mostly set in the English (?) countryside, with focus surrounding an old castle, with time travelling thrown in. I read it after translation, so it must've been popular. I'll try to write as much details as I remember. Some details may be wrong, but I think the general plot is distinct.SPOILER STARTIn one of the books, the protagonists are a brother and a sister. I remember the girl being younger. They moved into an old house beside a castle, and while playing, they found chests of old clothes in the attic. The clothes were from different historical times. They kids tried on the clothes, and found themselves transported back in time. The time travel was always based on the era the clothes came from. They saw the castle during its haydays, and even war at one point. They were able to participate in the regular activities of the era because they blended in. I think they used this knowledge to find a treasure in their present time, in hopes of restoring the castle to its former glory. In the end, I think they found that their father was an heir to the estates, which helped to reverse the family's fortunes, as they were poor.In a sequel, an orphan (I think his name was Tom), was picked up by a sketchy man. The man is not the most honourable, and used Tom to beg money, pretending he was the father and that they fell on hard times. They traveled throughout the country, somehow making a living. One day, Tom came into a toy wooden badger (?). He was playing with it one night, arranging his new toy with some sunflower (?) seeds, and fell asleep with the badger in the middle, and the seeds forming a pattern around it. He dreamt that a badger asked him a question. When he woke, he was transported back in time, and he was the son of a lord at a castle. I believe he used the excuse that he was sick, so he didn't remember any details of his life in this new timeline. He was educated in many things, including wood carving, and shipbuilding. He took these skills to his present day to help his pretend father on a better path, by carving wooden boxes and selling them, instead of begging. They continued traveling and Tom's pretend father wanted to visit his dad, who lived at a castle and worked as a groom (or at least worked with the hounds). At some point, Tom ran into the 2 children in the previous book, who were helping to restore the castle. They found that he was the true heir to the estates, related to the siblings' family somehow. Tom decided that he didn't want to take the inheritance away from his newfound relations, and that he preferred the other timeline. So in the end, he faked his death, with the help of the magic badger, and forever lived in the past instead. The 2 other children knew it was faked at first, but due to the magic, they slowly forgot, and learned to grieve Tom's death instead.SPOILER ENDThere might've been more books in the series, but these 2 are what I remember. Other details that are a bit blurry: there were trains and electricity in the \"present\" timeline, so the books are likely at least early 20th century. I somewhat remember the author was a woman. There were illustrations in the books. The badger was a motif throughout the series, as a wise, magical guide. There was a nanny\/witch who assisted the children throughout, who seemed to exist in all the timelines.If anyone could tell me what the names of the books are, I'd really appreciate it! Thank you."}

The main character now has a new sister (maybe two), one around the same age, possibly another one that's younger (my memory is fuzzy on that part). Somehow they come into possession of a pony or horse, the sisters argue about who they should belong to. They figure out how to put up a sort of fence in their yard for the pony\/horse.

They would have been \"cozy\" (not dark or scary) and not gross or overly tongue-in-cheek (i.e., not captain underpants-esque). The art on the cover was straightforward and attractive, not very garish or cartoonish. The books were relatively short, so they were on the thinner side.I am reasonably sure the author was NOT Cressida Cowell, Suzanne Collins, Chris Colfer, Bruce Coville, or William Corlett. I do not think the author had another more popular series (at least not at the time.The books were in paperback in 2010, but I sense that they are likely not to have been hardcover first.

{"book_id":798148,"query":"It's driving me crazy- I can remember so much of the plot but not the title!Children or middle grade book, not very long. The title may have had something to do with flowers, or at least the cover of mine did. The main character is a young girl, possibly named Ruth but I'm not sure, being raised mainly by a single father. Her mother is kind of a flake and is in \"the city\" most of the time, trying to become an actress I think. MC is unpopular because she's poor (I think her house might not have had good plumbing, so she couldn't bathe often) and the other girls tease her. The meanest girl may have been named Marcie and she definitely gets polio towards the end of the book. She makes a friend eventually, who IIRC was the most popular + richest girl, but when the war (WWII I think) starts the rich girl's family has to move into a trailer on the land of the MC, whose father is now richer because he sold some of his land to the government for a test site or something of that nature. Pretty sure the last scene was the friend's mom tailoring the MC's dress for her or something like that."}

I think there was magic in the book but I don't know how -- it kind of reminded me of Tamora Pierce but I don't think it's one of hers.

The book itself was short, about the width of the original hobbit book. From what I remember, two children wake up in their room, their room is dusty and they feel really cold and they can't find their mother. After walking around they come across two ghost children and a ghost adult who is the ghost's childrens aunty. The aunty has red hair and treats the ghost children poorly. When the main children try to leave the property they can't. The story is set in winter with snow and cold and a frozen lake mentioned. Either old America or England SPOILER ALERTAt the end you find out its the other way around, the original children are actually dead and the \"ghosts\" are the people now in the house, they end up helping the other children get away from their aunt by tricking her into drowning in the frozen pond, the same frozen pond they drowned in, at the end they go back to their room to \"sleep\" and the story ends with them waking up to their mother. The ends hints that the mother has now died and they are all off to the afterlife. The aunts hair is spoken about quite a bit as a interaction she has with one of the children, she grabs at them and they find her touch burning hot, as in causes pain, her hair is described as fiery red and it adds to the 'evilness' of her character, the cold is mentioned alot as well, kind of foreshadowing the twist at the end."}

There are guard dogs outside the room, but she tames them by feeding them meat from the food they are given. The littlest child (a girl) cannot pronounce the word \"kitchen\" - instead she says \"chicken\" - which leads to a semi-comedic scene with one of the kidnappers which eventually leads them to being allowed in the kitchen of the house they are being held in. The babysitter does eventually aid in the escape by climbing out onto the roof, I think?Besides that, I remember there being a slightly uncomfortable scene near the beginning of the book where the babysitter thinks about how her friend is wearing a shirt with a rose on it that is meant to attract boys to look at her chest.I read this sometime between 2005-2007, but given that my school library kept a lot of old books from previous decades it was probably published before the new millennium (for some reason I feel like the book had a 70s-ish vibe so it may have been published in that decade - not a historical fiction)"}

It is possible the title is something like \"Tales From____ \" or \"Grizzly Tales from____.

While out on a walk with his parents, he becomes lost. He gets nervous and begins to pick his nose and eventually his finger gets stuck in his nose. Someone says he will help him get his finger out before his parents find out. They go to the stranger's shop and the stranger tells the child to put his elbow on to a hook so he can pull his finger out. The child does this and the stranger hoists the child to the ceiling. In the end, it turns out he was found by a local butcher who wanted to punish him for picking his nose.Another story focused on a teacher obsessed with encouraging a kid in her class to continue reading classic novels. One of the books the kid reads is Dracula. The teacher decides to wear a coak with bats on the inside and after a class, once the other kids have left, he opens his coat for the kid. The kid is terrified and runs away. The teacher is confused and worried the kid will not continue to reread classic stories. I believe the kid at some point mentions he wants to read Frankenstein next. The teacher, feeling like he crushed the kids' desire to read, he decides to go to the local morgue and get the local undertake to give him body parts to make his own Frankenstein and show it to the kid. He takes all the body parts including a torso from someone who had been in an accident with a horse carriage (I believe) earlier that day. The next class the student is not there so the teacher goes to the kids' home only to discover it was the kid who had been killed by the horse carriage after he ran away in horror from his teacher.Some of the stories include the undertaker whose name I think is something like Mr.Crumb or Mr.Crowley but I could be wrong."}

In those days, she allows the child\/children to indulge excessively in whatever their un-desired behavior is, and uses the natural consequences that comes from that to teach the children why not to do that.One family had a couple of children who liked to stay up way past bedtime. When she came to watch the kids, she let them stay up to watch The Late Show and the Late Late Show, but made them get up at a normal time and still do everything they normally do in a day. After a few days, the kids were so tired that they started going to bed at a normal time.Another family had one girl who would not brush her teeth and had very bad breath. (I believe?) she had her eat strong-smelling food and wear a helmet that would keep the smell right by her face and would not let her brush her teeth until the child threw a fit and started brushing her teeth on her own.I think there was another story about kids eating too much junk food, and possibly a few others stories as well (maybe one involving a pet dog? although that could be the bedtime one).What I know it to be\/not to be:- it is not part of the babysitter's club series- I do not believe it was a series at the time that I read it (unsure if it was turned into one later)- it was a chapter book, not a graphic novel or comic book- I read it when I was around 8 or 9 years old and was part of the target audience- given my age at time of reading, I remember nothing about the cover unfortunately"}

This was one of my first bigger chapter books I can remember reading, so the reading level was probably around 1st-3rd grade. The book's cover had a locked dollhouse\/playhouse on it and there were thorns around it. The background scene on the front cover looked like a forest. The main characters were two siblings, the older was female and the younger was male. The younger brother really liked ketchup. The kids in the book had just moved with their mom (I don't remember if there was a dad, I don't think there was) and the house didn't have a backyard, it was just woods behind the house so they would go exploring in the afternoons. One of the first times they went out into the forest I remember one of the siblings walking on a log or tripping on a log. The playhouse was in the woods and I think the two characters find a key for it somewhere while they're walking on the first day after they move, then when they find the playhouse they use the key because it was locked. I remember they talked about how strange it was for the dollhouse to be left all alone in the woods and so they claimed it for themselves because nobody else was around to claim it. The two kids played in the little house in the woods behind their house all the time and the wallpaper was haunted\/alive I think? I don't remember if throughout the whole book they can go into the wallpaper that's in the playhouse, but at the end they are for sure able to. There's a girl in the wallpaper who's kinda creepy. Whenever they visit she keeps saying things like oh you guys should stay here with me forever this is so fun. Something bad kept happening halfway through the book whenever they went to the playhouse so they agreed to stop going. At the end of the book the younger brother goes by himself to the playhouse and the sister tracks him down and she realizes he's in the wallpaper that time because there's ketchup on the walls or on the floor of the playhouse. She goes in after him and fights the girl in the wallpaper because he got stuck in the wallpaper.

{"book_id":13072229,"query":"This book is about a teenage girl living in Prescott, Iowa, who has terrible nightmares of fighting as a soldier in a strange dream world, that no one can figure out how to stop. She lives with her single mother, and is an only child. Her town was dying, but an alien spaceship crash-landed near her town, and since no aliens defended the downed ship (despite that no one discovered any alien corpses) , so the townspeople stripped the ship. The technology they found on it vastly revolutionized their own, saving the town. For instance, I think their phones are bracelets with holoprojections, but if they want to have their hands free, without messing up their or their caller's views, they can put in a contact that projects an image of their friend a few feet in front of their eyes.SPOILERS:The mom eventually admits that the girl's dad is the alien no on ever found, and sends her to him (he lives nearby in the country and looks human) because hopefully he can help her with nightmares. He tells her that her nightmares are actually genetic memories passed down from her ancestors of fighting with these other aliens they are at war with still, or something like that. The dad also has I think a dog and a robot named Esu which he programmed to replicate human emotions, though the robot is still a work in progress. At some point, I think the girl's best friend and maybe a boy show up. Eventually, a ship comes to pick up her dad so he can go home, but some baddies (enemy aliens) attack them as well, and they have to fight.

The graffiti isnt called graffiti but something else like Skrizzle (NOT SURE). Skrizzles are supposed to be much better than normal graffiti. He once discovers such a Skrizzle and faints, because it is so overwhelming. There is a legend about a famous sprayer who created such a Skrizzle.

{"book_id":7076790,"query":"I'm looking for a Young Adult novel that I read somewhere between 2008 - 2013 (it was  published before October of 2013, because I moved away from the library I borrowed it from that month; I also remember reading it during Spring or Summer). I'm almost positive it was newly published at the time that I read it, most likely in the United States as the setting in the book was the U.S. The book was a Contemporary work (modern day, taking place in the 2000s\/2010s). There  have been a basketball on the cover, but I'm not confident on that fact. I do not know what gender the author was, nor am I confident on anything to do with the title. I do remember that each chapter within the book was  short, as in a few pages per chapter (but there were a lot of chapters).Plot details, MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD:The story was about a black male teen (I want to say around sixteen or seventeen years of age, give or take - he was still in school). He lived in a small apartment in the city with his mom (it was definitely a U.S. city, more than likely New York). His mother was physically abusive toward him and he had a bad relationship with her (there was a scene I recall in which she had beaten him, then left him lying on the ground, curled up and crying). I think it talked about him never having met his father, or possibly even knowing who his father was. His mother was dating either one guy, or jumping around dating different men, who were portrayed in a negative light. Anyway, the MC was dating a girl, but they were having issues in their relationship and I don't remember her being actually in the story much. He kept texting her throughout the book (I think he had a flip phone) but she wasn't responding much, and at some point she ended up dumping him via text. Shortly before that the boy had had some important test he had to take (maybe the SATs?) and had failed or gotten a very low score on (there might have even been something about him considering cheating on it, I'm not sure). The test results combined with his girlfriend dumping him were the final straws in his life, and he ended up attempting to commit suicide. He tried jumping from a balcony or the roof of the apartment complex where he lived. I remember he landed on a car parked below, but he survived the suicide attempt and woke up in a hospital. There was some negative situation to do with his mom (I think she showed up and was responding selfishly about the situation instead of caring), but his (maternal?) aunt showed up and got his mom out of the room. I remember thinking the aunt was a random addition, because it hadn't mentioned her before that in the book. His aunt was very kind and understanding and I think they talked about his father.I don't remember what all happened after that, but in the end of the story his aunt told him \"Let's just go.\" and they spontaneously got in her car and drove away, leaving all of their problems behind them.So that is my very descriptive memory of the book, but despite recalling all of that I  remember the dang name of the book or find it anywhere!! Grr >:( lol If you made it this far and read all of this, let me just say . And if  can help me find this elusive book, I would be eternally grateful to you and your descendants for generations to come O:) Thank you in advance for any help.

I remember the \"outer frame\" details more than the main body of the book.Setting begins in a medieval-style small town, with a young man as the Main Character. He is the usual type of everyday, simple small town boy who wishes he could have a more exciting life. A magician\/mysterious man\/snake-oil-salesman type sets up his act in the public square, and invites onlookers to come participate. Our MC steps up with others goading him on. The man has a tub or large bucket of water in front of him; he grabs MC's head and unexpectedly dunks him in the water.When MC fights back and comes up for air, he finds that he is emerging from the ocean on an unknown beach. Assorted trials and adventures ensue in this new land, including a love interest. [This is the main body of the book.]Just when it seems that the story is close to being resolved, and a \"happily ever after\" ending is in sight, our MC falls into a body of water, and then has his head pulled back out of the tub by the magician in his old small town. The crowd laughs and jeers, because all they have seen is MC get his head dunked. Despite protestations from MC, who wants to return to Love Interest and his new life, the magician packs up and continues on his way. And the book ends.Personal note here: I have a clear memory of silently crying when I first read this book. I was very caught up in the story taking place, and the ending took me by surprise. At the time, it felt extremely unfair to me, that MC should not have his proper \"fairy tale happy ending\", and only be left with bittersweet feelings of loss."}

{"book_id":219677,"query":"I read this at least fifteen years ago if not twenty. I thought the book was entitled after the female lead, and I thought her name was Sirena, but all such searches have turned up wrong, so I am probably remembering incorrectly.Anyway, the female lead is a mermaid. She has 49 sister and 50 brothers, though the story mentions her brothers were cast into the ocean (not the Mediterranean Sea, where the females were sent) and all eaten by orcas. The whole brood were children of Eros and a fish when Eros got a \"roving eye\" the night after seducing another woman. Being demi-goddesses, the mermaid were all promised immortality if they could seduce a mortal man.I think by the time the story began, one or two sisters had already passed away. The female lead and her remaining sisters use their siren song to lure three (ish) boats to their island, where they crash on the rocks.The surviving sailors are, needless to say, NOT happy about that and throw rocks at the mermaids every time they get close. They even yank one sister onto shore and stone her to death. The men trust nothing about the mermaids, and things get bad when there's no fresh water supply on the island. The female lead tries to convince them to eat the flowers, which do have moisture, but they don't believe her. All the men die of dehydration.The next time ships get close, the female lead refuses to sing her siren song and instead tries to warn the ships to avoid her sisters. One ship crashes, but the others are able to successfully turn away. I think the female lead got injured during this. But this does prove to be her breaking point, and she leaves her sisters.She lives off the shore of an isolated island for a long time until a single ship deserts one of its own men there. The man (male lead) had been cursed by Hera and bitten by a snake. He pleads with them to not leave him, but they see him as an ill omen and leave him to die. The female lead takes pity on him, as by morning he is delirious with fever, and cleans his wound using a shell and salt water. He wakes up and winds up surviving on the island, but every night the snake's venom returns and leaves him near dead by morning.Eventually the female lead reveals herself to him, and she expects him to be repulsed, but they wind up falling in love. She gains her immortality, and she also eventually teaches him to swim by watching how frogs swim in the spring. She only ever uses her siren song to protect herself from a bear, and the male lead is surprised she never sings for him as she has such a beautiful voice.Eventually, the female lead had to make a choice. The male lead gets the option to return to mainland Greece, where is wound would be forever healed and the curse on him broken. But they would never see each other again. The female lead ultimately decides to let him go with the memories of their love together being enough to get her through eternity.She also learns her sisters all achieved immortality and I believe she returns to live with them. The book also mentions mermaids usually go around topless and adorn their hair with shells and starfish.Any help is appreciated, and thank you so much again!"}

Referenced a well-documented encounter with a poltergeist which included being hit by small spiral sea(?)shells, moving through the air as if in slow-motion, then falling away diagonally; a Greek belief that if a woman conceived on a particular date and gave birth on Christmas, the child would be born a \"Chaos\"(?) (a demon); the composer of the song \"Gloomy Sunday\" which was tied to several high-profile suicides, incl. the writer himself. Lots about the #13, and black cats (white cats in England), not walking under ladders, and the like. Also - Countess Elizabeth Bathory who bathed in the blood of captive virgins in a bid to stay young and beautiful, and who was subsequently bricked up in a room for her crimes. There was a picture of her looking smug in the tub, holding a human heart, I think. And lots of revolting Vlad the Impaler facts, too.There was also a description of the origins of carving root vegetables on the night before All Saint's Day, where they carried carved turnip lanterns through the farmer's fields to chase off the evil spirits in \"the ceremony of Lating\" (Latting?).

The mentor has magic marbles, or maybe beads, that they keep some sort of box and you have to crush them to get some sort of power, it might be protection. On the journey, they have to cross a big canyon at some point, and I think they drop some of the marbles. They get to a town with a castle, the castle is very large and has mechanisms that involve moving water around and gears in the walls. I don't remember really what the goal was, but the MC and the group of pickpockets goes into the castle and there's a big plan that involves using a tunnel system and the gears in the walls.

The version I read was a paperback with a bright orange cover and I think it had a portrait of a teenage girl on it.It's a coming-of-age story told from the perspective of a teenage girl -I forgot the name. There's a bit of a love triangle with a boy in her school she's crushing on and she has confused feelings for her childhood best friend, I think his name might have been Jake or sth similar. They more or less grew up together, since his father is absent\/abusive and his mother might be dead (?), so he spends a lot of time with her family and she previously thought of him as more of a brother. During the story their relationship becomes strained, she's confused about her feelings for him and he's becoming more and more withdrawn. --potential spoiler--Towards the end of the book, he comes out as gay at a cemetery. There is also some tension between the girl and her father -nothing serious I think, just normal teen defiance.

I believe it was a young adult book but I'm not to sure.It starts with a boy and his father trying to survive before being attacked in a cave and the father falling into a coma. The boy's around 13-15, I believe. A trio of men find the cave they're hiding in, the son is using his father as bait and is hiding in the shadows. The boy has a young child set in his scope (doesn't plan on shooting), and the men managed to convince him it's safe.They take the father and son to their town that has a lot of rules. They're taken into a family's home and the woman there was a vet, tells the son she will care for his father and that he is in a coma. I remember there being a scene with a feeding tube.The town has a strike system, and if you mess up they kick you out and no one is meant to help them. If you cause to many problems you have to leave. An example was of a drunk father and his young daughter having to leave due to him causing trouble. They had nothing but some blankets the nice family gave them.The nice family has an adoptive daughter, who is a Chinese orphan. She gets into trouble alot and is usually mad. She and the son eventually get together.Later on, it is explained that a certain family in town basically controls everything and that they are awful people but they're the strongest so no one tries to oppose them. The girl and son eventually lead a rebellion against the corrupt family and free the town.There is also a part where the girl tries to distract some bad guys by pretending to lead a Chinese attack against them.

I also vaguely believe the title was just one word, but that might be wrong. I also think this novel was part of a series but I never read the other books. (I think the others had similar covers and one of them might have had a red hue, rather than the purple, they also might have all been singular word titles)As far as plot goes, all I remember is that it started out with the male love interest showing up in the female main characters bedroom by coming in through her window. He explains that he has to take her away to this secret kingdom and I'm pretty sure the reason for that was that she was secretly the heir to the throne there. Unfortunately, I cannot remember if there was a supernatural element to this or not. It's entirely possible that that man had wings or something. I do also remember there being a character named Rhys, and I think there was a love triangle at some point (I mean its a ya romance fantasy novel, of course there was a love triangle).I'm sorry, I know that's not much!

The boy is friends with a neighborhood kid who's parents own a candy store. The neighborhood kid has a lot of siblings and they live in a small apartment. The boy's father meets a nice lady and the boy likes the lady as well. They decide to get cheaply married and the reception has lots of sandwiches. His father is a bad driver and the boy and lady bond over this. The boy's grandfather dies and the boy is set to inherit a lot of money.

Some of these animals include a fish that swims backward on land, kicking up a huge dust cloud, and a goat with uneven legs (the right-side legs are shorter than the left-side legs, so it can stand on steep inclines).Throughout the story, the man constantly feels like there's something behind him, but every time he turns around, there's nothing. He turns faster and faster, but it isn't until the very end where he whips around extremely fast that he finally sees what's been behind him the whole time. It's some kind of monster with orange fur (something like George Sanderson from Monsters, Inc.). The orange monster stands there embarrassed for a moment, then turns around and disappears into thin air, leaving behind an orange tuft of fur.I  there's also a part where the man wakes up one morning, and it's so cold that when the rooster opens its mouth to crow, it freezes instantly?

The book was VERY OLD at the time, yellowed, somewhat brittle pages at that time, published prior to 1990 and as old as possibly very early 1900's. It was set in the very early 1900's or around there (could've been as early as the late 1800's I guess.) It was a multi-chapter book, not a picture book. But it wasn't more than about 1 cm thick paperback. I classify it as YA because it wasn't a children's book but would have been in the style of what like, middle-grade to YA fiction was at the time of publishing.The story was about a little girl (4-9) who lived with her older sister (16-19) in New York city (I think, it was for sure a large East Coast city) in a little apartment. The story is told by\/or from the perspective of the younger girl. They were orphaned, no living parents. Her old sister worked and she attended school. There's a chapter\/scene where they share a meal with a family and they eat clams, or possibly oysters, for the first time. It's a riot. They aren't extremely wealthy but not terribly poorly off, although there may have been a slight financial struggle. Spoiler::::::Near the end of the book, the older sister gets very sick during wintertime. There may have been an issue with the heating stove in the apartment, I don't recall. She gets a cold and maybe pneumonia. It starts as a little cough that gets progressively worse until she's near death. Ultimately the little girl leaves the apartment to get help, despite her sister's insistence that she will be fine (possibly they financially couldn't get a doctor) and I believe it ends with the older sister recovering.Possible points: There may have been a slight love interest for the older sister but it wouldn't have been a major plot point, at least not until the end. They may have lived in a boarding house, not an apartment, I can't recall.EDIT: As far as I know, I believe this was a standalone book and not part of any series."}

It centers around a male main character, who wakes up in a secret base (possibly on a private island) where juvenile delinquents from all over the world are whisked away to, in order to be taught how to take their petty crimes, and turning them into hardened crime bosses.The classes that all the students took were specifically designed to cater towards whatever crimes got them recruited in the first place. I don't remember what the MC's crime of choice was, but I do remember that one of his fellow recruits, described as a pretty boy, got really upset when he saw that his schedule was full of classes focusing on the sex trade\/trafficking. Apparently he assumed he'd just gotten out from under his own pimp, and had no desire to continue in that line of work. The school wouldn't let him leave until the semester was over, and he wasn't deemed to be a good fit. So the boy flagrantly failed all of his classes and just counted down the days until he got to leave. The MC was, presumably, putting in effort to fit in and do well while this was happening.One day toward the end of the semester, just when report cards were being released, the failing boy was found dead, made to look like a suicide (I think from jumping off something high), but the MC is convinced that it was murder, so the school wouldn't release him back into the world and potentially reveal all of their secrets.I don't really remember the ending, except that the climax had something to do with the headmaster, who'd just taken it over from his predecessor (possibly his father\/grandfather), and the MC either killed him, or led him to his death. Then the MC leads the rest of the students out to freedom. The end"}

It was a YA short story collection where each story takes place sometime in the future after a parallel universe is discovered. This discovery happens in the first story and it is made by a teenage boy who as I recall meets some kind of beautiful girl from the other world. In the subsequent stories this boy becomes mythologized as the one who discovered this world. His name was something really basic like Daniel. Each subsequent story features a teen protagonist dealing with the world after this parallel world is discovered. In one story a boy is living in a city turned virtual game board (I even remember something akin to this exact phrasing being used). (SPOILERS BELOW!)The story about the boy playing the AR game in the future ends with what is implied to be an atomic bomb detonation and a subsequent nuclear war. The final story takes place in the distant future where the technology that made this AR game possible has become indistinguishable with the magical and supernatural to the few humans who remain. The protagonist of this final story ends up causing the world to finally end, as she is met by a resident of the parallel world who tells her that their worlds are colliding and so only one world can survive.

They are able to talk to their ship in their head, I think the ship's name was Darla? I'm not sure but he tries to talk to her but she doesn't answer so he looks at other pods. Walking further he sees that like a monster has broken the ship. Although further away on a different ship the main girl protag (GP) is the daughter of the people who own a giant spaceship. It tells us that GP has a robotic parasite down her throat that can control her vocal cords and stop her from speaking and sometimes moving. The ex-boyfriend (XB) finds her in the hallway and corners her knowing that she cannot talk about the parasite in her throat. She eventually gets away and to the main control room. On GP's ship, they all have robotic bracelets in their skin that control the ship's doors and system and stuff like that. GP goes into the main control room and see's that someone messed with the controls and she tries to fix it but ends up not helping it. The ship crashes into the BP ship and she is like thrown around. She goes to their treasure room and grabs the declaration of independence because she says it's her moms favorite. so she crawls onto BP ship and meets BP she is like battered so he picks her up and the parasite has made it so she can't talk and all that fun stuff.

When the boy comes into their life, the guy married to the boys mom was like sketchy and doing everything to keep the boy from ruining the moms chances of winning an election since I believe she was running for mayor or some government position. Since the mom is pretty wealthy, she is able to get the son a tutor and enroll him in a much better school.

It was a contemporary story, with a pretty realistic vibe - except the main character, was a writer and the things she wrote about in her new story kept happening to her and her friends. Some of the chapters were in a different typeface and were supposed to be the chapters from the book-within-the-book.The main \"character\" of the book-within-the-book and her friends were invited to stay at a gothic mansion - and then the \"writer\" and her crush (and maybe his sister?) were invited to stay at a big, mysterious house, too. The \"character\" discovered there was a groaning man (a painter, maybe?) hidden away in one of the attics of the fictional house - and then the \"writer\" discovered that their landlord's troubled younger brother was living at the house she was staying at, too. She wrote a hookup scene between her character and her crush - and the next thing she knew, she's was making out with the real guy she liked, etc.I remember that the \"character's\" distinguishing traits were that she was always squinting due to her astigmatism and she was an oboe player who was constantly walking around with an oboe reed in her mouth. The house had a \"bower\" in the backyard. At least the \"writer\" described it to her would-be-boyfriend as \"a bower\" when she took him there to make out.

It turns out that each world has a portal up to the next dimension as well as down one, but most people don't know about them. I don't remember if he was able to go to the 2-D world or just look through and talk with some of the inhabitants.

On the Title: I THINK it was called The Mysterious Island, but I've had no luck with searches of that title, because Jules Verne wrote a book of that name.On the cover: The cover was a deep green or blue with a foresty island. The water had a stingray in it and the sky may have had a bird in it. On the plot: Two girls were, in some fashion, sent to an island with a mad scientist. I believe they were not together and just met in the circumstances. The main character, if I remember right, crashed her car and sought refuge with a nearby person to call for help but then was captured. I could be mixing this up, however, with other stories that follow that trope. Nontheless she wakes up in some secret facility with no way out.The mad scientist gave them an option of breathing under water or flying. Over time it became clear he was turning them into a fish or a bird. The main character was a girl and she chose to breathe under water, the mad scientist thought that this was boring and showed a lot of favoritism and care for the other person who chose to fly. I remember the transformation taking a long time and causing a lot of suffering for them both. The main character turned into a stingray specifically. However, she was able to use her swimming ability to escape the island, I believe with help from the bird girl as well they could both escape.I don't remember the characters names or anything about them as characters, mostly the plot of the book.On the genre: I only think it's YA because I pictured the girls younger like I was, but I could be wrong on this fact, I read it a very long time ago in late middle school or early highschool, 12 to 14 years old. I personally bet it was in 2003 when I was in eighth grade. The reason I think I could be wrong was because I remember it being a bit vivid in the suffering and details of being slowly mutated into an animal. I believe it is YA, however, because I'm pretty sure I saved money to buy it from a scholastic catalogue or a book fair. However, as an adult that kind of shocks me haha.It was definitely a darker genre. Zero romance. Scary, mysterious. Plot twists etc. Like, they didn't know when they made the choice of which they would rather have, that they were essentially signing a deal to be a bird or an aquatic animal. It dealt a lot with the friendship and dynamics between the two girls, and how she viewed the mad scientist. It dealt with pain and loneliness, searching for freedom, and anger in an impossible situation. She really found out she liked being a stingray though."}

The father explains to the son that he felt unable to be a parent, which is why he let the mother take on the role as primary caretaker, but he sees that was a mistake.The father (\"Professor\") and the son move away from the town into a more remote area in the wilderness. As the book progresses, the son becomes older and closer to his father and begins his schooling again. The book ends with the son developing a friendship with an odd girl at the school. The same author of this book has another book that focuses on the girl the boy befriends.This is the most I can remember now, I don't remember any other specific names other than \"Professor.\" Any suggestions are appreciated!"}

I believe the in-story journal has the same title as the book itself. The MC and her friends use what they learn from the journal to gain popularity and get back at the popular kids. In the beginning, everything our protagonists do feels deserved and just, but as the novel goes on it becomes clear that the protagonists are becoming just as vindictive and cruel as popular kids they hated. One of the last pranks they pull involved humiliating the popular girls by photoshopping their faces onto dogs (including one eating poop) and posting them around the school. The MC's boyfriend breaks up with her for this prank because he believes they've gone too far. Near the end of the novel, the older sister comes home and the MC tells her what's been going on. The older sister is upset by this and reveals that she is deeply ashamed of that journal and how she behaved in high school. The older sister explains that her and her friends bullied one student so badly that they attempted suicide\/self harm (and\/or dropped out). The sister also reveals that as a result of this incident, she started attending therapy.

{"book_id":853005,"query":"I borrowed this book from the lancaster county library system as a kid in the early 2000s. It was a large hardcover library bound book with lots of color illustrations. The illustrations were more realistic than cartoon. This fiction book was about a family whose parents were scientists and they had maybe 2-4 kids. They lived in this huge submarine with a kitchen, bedrooms, lab etc. They discovered this new species of dolphins that had these unique frills on their heads. I think the leader of the dolphin group was named Frill. As the family was studying the dolphins from inside the sub, pictures started flashing on the screen. They figured out the dolphins could communicate with these special frills on their heads - kinda an extention of sonar. The family found a way to communicate verbally with the dolphins (I think they invented something) and the dolphins helped them explore the ocean. I remember one of the kids hurt thier leg. Frill told them to put thier leg in the water and she swam up and used her sonar\/telepathic thing to heal the leg."}

I think she has a sister as well? The book wasn't fantasy (such as medieval times), but just a regular girl who stumbles upon a dragon.Books that I have seen suggested in other forums, but are not what I am looking for: Scorched, Dragon Rider, Hatching Magic, The Secret of Dragonhome, Jeremy Thatcher, Waterhorse, The Dragon Circle, Falcon's Egg, Dragon's Egg, Dragons Blood, DragonSpell, Dragon's Milk, Voices of Dragons, Dragon Slippers, Book Two: This one is about a young girl who goes on a sailing trip with her father, another man (I cannot remember the relation), and a young boy who I remember being described as moving like a puppet and was kind of annoying. I also remember them coming to an island at one point and it was abandoned or something along those lines? I also remember the cover being majority blue, for the ocean probably?

{"book_id":1954228,"query":"The book was written in the 20th century because I read it sometime in the 1980s. But it could have been originally written earlier like 1950-1970. It had a Nancy Drew type feel in terms of the pacing of the book and the setting's time frame, but the main character was younger. It was not a heavily illustrated book - if there were any illustrations, they would have been interspersed throughout the book or used as embellishments at the start of each chapter number.Synopsis:Young person (I believe a girl) enters an antique shop and befriends the owner OR the owner is a distant relative that the young person is visiting for the summer. The shop owner has three animatronic monkeys that represent See No Evil, Hear No Evil, and Speak No Evil and they are the key to unraveling a mystery but the shop owner can't figure it out. The young person eventually figures out the clues by getting each monkey to \u00e2\u0080\u009cperform\u00e2\u0080\u009d and deciphering what its performance means. I believe the final monkey types something out on a typewriter and this clue leads to a birdcage located in the antique shop that looks basic but is really valuable or made of a material that is really expensive. The end was anticlimactic but the monkeys kept things interesting. I believe a thief might have been trying to break into the shop at one point to steal the monkeys, but that may be me adding to the story."}

So, I'm going to talk about the two of them since it could make things easier. I've read the two books about two years ago. While reading the books I've discovered that they have a lot in common (in terms of character).So, let's goThe first one is about a girl who changes city with her family(I think \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u0094). Her brother is in prison. So, her parents put a lot of pressure on her. While she drives in the neighborhood, she comes across a pizzeria and decides to eat there. When she enters the pizzeria, she sees a boy (who is about the same age as her and is the love interest) leafing through a school book. She becomes friend with the sister of the boy. All of them are going to the same school. Her friend's mother is sick and is in a wheelchair. Her friend's brother (the love interesting) receive a lot of pressure on his shoulder, because his dad want him to be the owner of the pizzeria one day. Obviously, he doesn't want to. Later on the story, she finally go out with the guy, but doesn't want to tell her friend about it, because she's scared that she'll not be okay with it. One day, a friend of her brother (who I think also went to prison) who is like 3 years older than her come to visit her family. He than try, forcibly, to make a move on her, but her father come to her rescue and punch him.I don't recall at all the second book I read of this author. It's a girl who's mother put a lot of pressure on her shoulder (yeah..again) because her sibling left the house suddenly. She fall in love and go out with a guy that seems like a bad guy at first (all I can remember about him is that he wears locks and he's intelligent). At first, her mother did not like him, but she saw that he was intelligent and a gentleman, she changer mind. Later on the story, he change drastically of behavior and hit her (I don't even recall why) and her mother start yelling at him. Then, at the end of the story she meets with her sibling and they talk.I really have a bad memory and English isn't my first language, so it was difficult to write. Anyway I hope y'all can help me."}

She could also hurt other people with her touch, so she wasn't allowed to touch anyone. Her power caused moving weird black lines on her skin. (I thought of them as under the skin tattoos). He was kidnapped by the enemy, who was the female lead's father, for helping her out. Her father was a scary man\/villain. The first time she felt the absence of pain was when she touched him.His only job as a prisoner was to keep in contact with her so she didn't hurt. Only when she touched him she didn't feel pain. He was the only one who could touch her without hurting himself. They grew up together.There were prophecies about the both of them which burdened the characters during the course of the series. His was that he would kill her...? and hers was that she would cross the borders. They were from two opposing nations. Spoiler ahead.The plot twist was that they were exchanged as kids and the prophecies which had been dictating their lives since so long were not even their own. He had already crossed borders as a kidnapped child. And during a torture session she had once stopped his heart. In this way they had already fulfilled the prophecies which had actually been meant for them. Now they could be together.

Worried for her, the MC follows her to the castle, hoping to save her because every other woman who has married that man has never returned.While in the castle, our MC is unable to save her friend, but somehow ends up falling for the cursed man, since she understands he's also suffering. Things come to a boiling point for some reason I don't remember and she runs away, discovering how to save the man from his curse and free her friend who is also cursed.I think that her friend and all the previous sacrifices turn into skeletal beings, and our MC looks after each of them with love and care.In the next installement, our MC discovers she's actually some kind of nobility, but her mother died because some guy decided she should have married him. Since our MC looks a lot like her mom, the man becomes obsessed with her and tries to take her by force. Doesn't happen but I think there was some magical guardian deer looking after her... I think.In the last installement, having figured out that some witch is trying to destroy their world (she cursed the guy in the 1st book and worked with stalker obsessive dude in the 2nd) she and her husband (cursed dude, they had to get married for some magical reason I don't remember) go to his family (he's a prince!) to create an alliance and fight the witch.Our heroine figures out in the end that the witch was actually a half-goddess gone mad with grief because she herself isn't a goddess and she can't join her mother in some godly realm. She discovers that if she sacrifices herself, honoring her promise to her friend back in the beginning (something about never leaving her) she can put a stop to the witch and does so, saying her goodbyes to her friends and husband.I remember clearly that her husband pleads her to stay (he hasn't been very nice to her so far) while she urges him to be happy with the woman he had been engaged to before his curse. She then in some magical, mystical moment joins her friend and all the women who had been sent to the castle in the skies and stars.That's how it endsThanks to anyone who has any information about the book!"}

When the main character goes back in time, it's to Victorian London, and he meets a troupe of 'circus freaks' - I only remember two characters, both are important. One is a girl about the main character's age called Astrid: she has paper thin skin and is very delicate. There's some implied SA with her and the 'circus leader'. The other character is a very tall man, possibly called Tom or something similar. Tom is a very nice character, and at the end of the book, when the main character is helping the 'circus freaks' escape, Tom sacrifices himself by using his height to push the boat out on the Thames but drowns himself in the process. The main character, having helped saved these others, then goes back to his own modern time.

Once you were confirmed to have bad luck, you were removed from the people with good luck's society, their schools, work places, etc. The protagonist's adventures, I believe, were supposed to change her fate; give her good luck.

He had bright red\/orange hair which stood out a lot from the background. I don't remember where any words were placed or anything written on the cover.The story was about a young boy who was lost as a young child during what I think was a camping trip when he was accidentally abandoned. He was taken in by wolves and when his family tried to come back to find him they couldn't. Once he gets a bit older, the leader of the wolf pack that took him in decides he has to leave. This is the part that's somewhat dated. The wolves are described as having a strict alpha beta omega hierarchy which goes against more modern information about wolf family structures. He leaves them in order to have his own life, and I think I remember him understanding human language because he talks to various adults in the book. He eventually gets on a train accompanied by an adult woman(?) towards the end and finds his old family on a trip to the zoo due to the fact that his hair was incredibly distinct, and I think also because he had a twin sister. He returns to his family, and someone comments on how 'accurate' his information about wolf packs is because they read a book on wolf packs, and the information he provides about his experience is nearly identical.That's all I remember.

They would grieve the death of any member unless they had \"allowed\" themselves to be eaten, in which case they were spoken of with derision. Wasps are lethal enemies. Aphids are herd animals.I keep thinking the word \"Storm\", or maybe \"The Eye of the Storm\", is connected, maybe in the title or maybe from the cover picture. What I remember from the dust cover is that it was entirely black, or maybe very dark blue or green, but dark and solid, except for an eye in the upper center of the front. It was a full-sized novel, not a short story. The ideas in this story have stuck with me for over 40 years and I have searched for it often. I wanted to get it for my daughter but couldn't find it, and now I would like to get it for my grandchildren.Thanks for any help you can give."}

I read it in the country of Canada (it was in English), and it seemed like a book that would have been published in the 1990's. The book is about a family that is driving to the beach, Mom and Dad in the front of the vehicle and their young son and his dog in the backseat. The boy is probably 8 or 9 years old and I believe they are all white. The boy starts getting bored in the back as they are driving along the highway, so he decides to roll down his window, take off his sock and let it go out the window. He gets enjoyment out of this, so he does it with his other sock, then his shoes, then his shirt, then his pants. The book ends with the parents parking at the beach, opening the back of the vehicle and finding their son asleep in his underwear. I'm not sure how to describe the style of pictures, but they were maybe similar to Robert Munsch. I believe it was set in the present, and there wasn't much shown to indicate location but I'd guess North America or UK. Any help is appreciated, so thank you."}

I checked it out from a local library sometime between 208-2014 (I lost and restarted many library cards in those years and can't find it through the library card's history). I remember the plot was based on a high schooler (I believe they were male? but I keep going back and forth) who takes an afterschool\/night drawing class. Highlights\/plotlines include drawing nude figures (but it wasn't erotica) including an older man and a bigger woman. I remember the artist\/protagonist found out that drawing fatter bodies was really fun and they appreciated the curves\/lines. I think there was an older teen girl that the protagonist had a little bit of a crush\/admiration for, and the older teen helped them grow up, but they didn't end up together (I think). There miiiiight have been a sorta kinda highschool girlfriend who wanted to go to a school dance with the protagonist and they had internal turmoil over going to the dance w\/ high school friends vs class with older cool artist friends. I think the highschool girl might've been jealous of the older artsy girl? I think they chose to go to the dance\/stay younger a little longer but looked forward to being an artist. They were trying to seem older with the artist friends from class. I think it was based in the USA or had no memorable location based plotlines. These parts I'm shakier on, I really remember the part about appreciating fat and saggy\/older bodies as an artist but the rest of the plot is hazy. Comment here if you have any questions or ideas! Thank you fellow readers"}

{"book_id":30734222,"query":"Hello everyone, this is the first time im doing this so sorry for any mistakes.I read this novel in high school, so 2016\u00e2\u0080\u00932019 is in my library. Im pretty sure is was published post 2010. It takes place in modern day, i beleive United States. I forgot where the actaully plot takes place though What I remember takes place at what I think is a private high school. I could be wrong about whether it was public or not. The main character is a female who I think is disabled; I remember her using crutches. The main plot is about the student council and all the craziness around it. There is a psychopath girl who assaults the MC later in the novel; a male student who become the president gets attacked; and that's the big mystery later in the novel as well. I believe the novel is first-person, or jounral form, because the MC talks to the readers. There is also a dude who is rich and throws parties all the time, but I forgot how that relates to the plot. The reason I put Roman aesthetics in the topic is because the novel plays out like a Roman story. Like when a new person becomes president of the council, a page will have \"The Reign of Whoever\" with roman numerals and symbolism on it. I pretty sure the cover also had the style on it as well.Thats all I remember; again, this is my first time doing this, so apologies for any mistakes."}

Another distinct plot element I remember is the ending is the teenage boy is writes a letter addressed to his baby sibling (who is sleeping to room next door).

I think it was recently published, as it was on the table at Waterstones where they usually show off new books, but it's possible it was just on offer. The cover was pink or purple, or maybe a mix, and it had either a photo or illustration of a teenage girl on the cover.It was a YA(?) psychological thriller in which two sisters are kidnapped by a male (I think it was an adult, but it might have been another teenager older than them). The older sister is made pregnant by this man, and has a daughter (and I think a second child eventually). The sister and kidnapper raise the baby \"together\", although the kidnapper has much more control, and from what I remember is also abusive. At least one of the girls eventually escapes and goes back home; I think the younger girl first and then eventually the older one. I have a vague sense of a scene by a river near their family home, either a memory or something that happens after one girl escapes? It might have been the location that the kidnapping took place, which is then returned to near the end of the book? I think some years have passed before the older one goes back home, because the parents are shocked to see her, and I think I remember the baby she had growing into a toddler.I know there was massive plot twist as well, but I don't remember anything about it.I'm sorry this is a bit of a generic description!

Either at the beginning of the book or in flashbacks, we see 2 teenage girls (friends?) who are stranded on a boat in open water. One drinks seawater to combat dehydration, but the other doesn't because she is convinced this will ultimately hurt them. However, they end up being rescued soon afterwards, so the girl who drank the saltwater survives while the other girl doesn't. She goes back to her life in (I believe) a seaside town, and I think fishing is involved in their lives. I think that there is also an element of crime and\/or mystery, though I can't remember what it involves. We find out at some point that the girl who survived swapped identities for some reason with the other girl on the boat (made possible because after being stranded, starved, etc, she was unrecognizable). It's also possible that the girl who died on the boat was actually killed - the girl who survived might be lying about what happened.
